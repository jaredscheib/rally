## Sub-Heading ##
  > Rally turns group decision into action.

## Summary ##
  > Why is it so hard for groups of friends to make a decision about what to do and to get going? Too many options? Lost interest? Ambivalence? Hesitation? Rally is an app for any device that makes group decision-making fun, fast, and effective. It enables anyone with an inclination to get together with friends to send invites, suggest some ideas, and quickly reach consensus on what to do, where, and when. The app provides a simple interface to help groups move quickly from indecision to action by tallying votes among invitees on one or two sets of options that rally towards a concrete group decision. Rally, decision, go.

## Problem ##
  > It’s difficult to reach consensus as a group. Group planning in-person or over text message happens every day, takes forever, and often fizzles, ends up in gridlock, or people get frustrated. People lose interest, don’t have their opinion counted, or diverge because of indecision.

## Solution ##
  > Provides a medium to quickly reach consensus on a group decision via individual input.

## Quote from You ##
  > “Rally lets groups spend less time deciding and more time doing.”

## How to Get Started ##
  > Using Rally is incredibly easy. As an invitee, simply follow a link you'll receive in a text or email, vote on the options set by the event’s host, and you'll be notified when consensus has been reached so you can get out the door. To host an activity, simply visit the Rally web app and enter emails or phone numbers of your friends to invite. Set up a couple options for the decision to be made, then rally. Consensus will be reached rapidly, and you’ll be out the door. Never download or install anything.

## Customer Quote ##
